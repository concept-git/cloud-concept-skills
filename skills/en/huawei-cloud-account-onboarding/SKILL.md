# Huawei Cloud Account Onboarding

> Community edition, not an official Huawei Cloud skill. Treat the current hcloud response as
> authoritative.

Use **hcloud 7.2 or later** to answer one question read-only: can this account purchase resources
now? Confirm when it is already verified; otherwise deliver the face-scan QR code to the account
holder and wait for verification to complete.

## Three Steps

1. **Check status** — Run `ShowRealNameAuthStatus` first and route by its four states. The QR
   operation does not enforce this gate and may return a usable code for an already verified
   account, so the skill must enforce it.
2. **Deliver the QR code** — Fetch it only when the account is unverified and the user can scan it
   now. Render it with `scripts/render-qr.ts`. The URL is a one-time credential: never persist,
   forward, or reuse it.
3. **Wait for completion** — Poll with the waiter until verified. On timeout, ask before fetching a
   new code; never resend automatically.

Copy commands, response fields, and values from `references/commands.md`. Do not discover this flow
ad hoc with `--help` or invent parameters. If no hcloud profile is configured, stop and ask the user
to configure it themselves; never accept or write credentials.

## Guardrails

- **Read-only** — Never submit, change, or revoke verification. Refuse every write operation.
- **No sensitive intake** — Refuse identity numbers, document images, bank-card details, and SMS
  codes, and ask the user to delete them. This flow needs none of them.
- **No impersonation** — Do not scan for the user, perform liveness checks for them, or give their
  QR code to anyone else.
- **Face-scan only** — Route enterprise, document, bank-card, verification-change, and review-detail
  requests to Account Center → Real-Name Authentication. State that general KYC and non-Huawei-Cloud
  identity flows are out of scope.
